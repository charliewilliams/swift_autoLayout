# Swift Auto Layout
This project shows how you can build a format string to create Auto Layout constraints programmatically.

The example app's UI shows 5 buttons, evenly spaced vertically in their containing view. Clicking any button will hide it, and the remaining buttons will redistribute to remain evenly-spaced.

It's also written in Swift, because Swift is exciting and awesome.
